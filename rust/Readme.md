# Rust roadmap

Here you can find a set of exercises with the purpose of learning/improving **Rust** for anyone.

You can always find more information about **Rust** by reading [_The Rust Book_](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html).

## Exercises

Each exercise is defined with a 'readme' file, containing the following sections:

- **Objective**: Brief explanation of the main objective of the exercise.
- **Task**: Instructions to be included in the program.
- **Expected result**: The expected outcome when the program runs.
- **Theory**: The necessary theory to complete the exercise.

> Note: Each exercise assumes that the theory from the previous exercises is known.
