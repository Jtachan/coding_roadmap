# Coding Exercises Roadmap

In this repo you can find multiple exercises to master programming languages.

Each language's roadmap is organized by different exercises (each one in its own folder) containing:
- The theory to understand the topic it is to teach.
- A small exercise to practice what is new to learn, as well as using previous knowlege.
- The program file with the solution to the exercise.
