# Python roadmap

Here you can find a set of exercises with the purpose of learning/improving **Python** for anyone.

As a good practice, you should get familiarized with the [_Python General Docs_](https://docs.python.org/3/).
Here you will find all built-in modules and functions.

> Note: For these exercises it is expected that you have Python 3.11 of higher.
> Head to the 'Getting started' exercise for more information about installing Python.

## Exercises

Each exercise is defined with a 'readme' file, containing the following sections:

- **Objective**: Brief explanation of the main objective of the exercise.
- **Task**: Instructions to be included in the program.
- **Theory**: The necessary theory to complete the exercise.

> Note: Each exercise assumes that the theory from the previous exercises is known.
